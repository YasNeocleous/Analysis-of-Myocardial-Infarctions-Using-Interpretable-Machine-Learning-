Myocardial Infarction (MI, commonly known as heart attack) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot. Acute MI is associated with high mortality in the first year after it and its high incidence —especially in urban populations, due to lifestyle factors— makes it a leading cause of death globally. The course of the disease in patients with MI can vary considerably; MI can occur with or without complications and said complications can worsen the long-term prognosis or not. Even experienced specialists cannot always foresee the development of these complications. This makes, predicting MI patient survival an important task in order to timely carry out the necessary preventive measures. Therefore, throughout this project shallow machine learning techniques have been used to provide some explainability and improve the understanding of predictors of MI patient survival. A decision tree classifier (DTC) was used to differentiate between survivors and non-survivors based on clinical & demographic features, treatments administered and confirmed complications. A peak F1 score of 0.8478 was obtained when using a decision tree classifier, while when using a less explainable ensemble model (histogram gradient boosting, HXGB) a peak F1 score of 0.8222 was achieved.
